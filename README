                                                 a part of the torouter project
                     https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter


This is a simple/minimalist web interface for torouters, allowing owners/users
to configure a basic "home router"-style network and enable Tor onion-routed
services and daemons. It is writen in python.

### Features

- integrates elegantly with conventional Linux configuration files
- no javascript, just HTML5 and CSS
- no cookies, sessions, or server-side state
- compatible with lynx

### Dependancies

- Augueas config file editing library, plus python bindings.
- The Flask lightweight pythonic web framework
- basic UNIX utilities: top, uptime, hostname, etc
- ifupdown
- iproute2: supplies the 'ip' command
- procfs
- iw

The bundled CSS and image files are Twitter Bootstrap.

### Development

To resolve dependancies on debian-based systems (wheezy or newer?):

    $ sudo apt-get install python-flask python-augeas ifupdown iw

You can run try running the UI on any old Linux machine, just don't submit any
forms unless you want your network configuration clobbered:

    $ ./torouterui.py --debug
